Geoff is a development manager for AppNeta's TraceView
team. He has been an enthusiastic Pythonista since 1.5.2.
In a career including a variety of devops and engineering
roles, themes of performance, process, and elegant design
have emerged as passions. Prior to his programming
career, Geoff was a poet; he would love to tell you about
the conceptual overlaps between iambic pentameter and
good code.
